###### Vishakapatnam

Looking at the breezy mornings everyday in Vizag makes everyone want to go on a long drive to their favourite beach. Itâ€™s a daily habit for Vizagites to go for early morning walks, maybe some tea/coffee at RK Beach or a breakfast full of Dosa/Idli. If we want to hang out with friends, the Maggi Point at **Rushikonda Beach** is one of the most sought-after places in Vizag where young people, especially students, come together and have a plateful of Maggi by the beach. No matter what your empty belly desires in the morning, the various eateries in Vizag have some delicious food waiting for you.
